My sweet puppy is not a scurvy dog.
## Scurvy Dog

- **Historical insult** from the 17th-18th centuries meaning "contemptible wretch" or "worthless villain," combining "scurvy" (despicable) with "dog" (lowly person)

- **Nautical origins** made it especially popular among sailors and pirates, since scurvy disease was so common at sea

- **Modern usage** is purely playful and tongue-in-cheek, mainly used in pirate-themed entertainment and jokes
