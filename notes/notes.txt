# MCP Server class on O'Reilly

## Notes from class
MCP = Model Context Protocol

Standard way/protocol for AI host to access tools by sending requests via MCP client to tool's MCP server
Many companies have their own MCP Server
this means I would need to make my own MCP server for APIs that do not yet have one (eg LDAP)


### Set up environment
required dependencies for class:
- nvm
- claude desktop
- openai api key
- uv
- github

optional dependencies for class:
- azure portal account
- or some other remote vm

### Use Airbnb MCP in Claude desktop
claude desktop "mcp airbnb: spawn npx ENOENT":
- i don't have node or npx installed
- brew install node, thanks claude sonnet
- restart claude and now it works

Edit /Users/pezzutidyer/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json



Install stuff:
```
 1002  cd hello-world
 1003  uv init
 1004  uv venv
 1011  . .venv/bin/activate
```

had to install python 3.12, then change pyproject.toml to use >=3.10. then:
```
 uv add 'mcp[cli]'
```

### Hello World MCP Server

```
 mcp dev weather.py 
Need to install the following packages:
@modelcontextprotocol/inspector@0.17.2
Ok to proceed? (y) y
```


add directly to Claude desktop with this command. It edits claude_desktop_config.json. 
```
mcp install weather.py
```

### MCP client

In new dir, set up a virtual env.
```
mkdir cd 1074  cd client
uv init
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv add 'mcp[cli]'
 ```
